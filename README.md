# web-calculator

A calculator built using web technologies.

# Instructions

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a user interface for the calculator functions from the [JavaScript Calculator Exercise](https://github.com/fe-101-sea-nov-15-2016/javascript-calculator).

For each problem, make the appropriate ```input``` elements for the users to enter their inputs and a button for them to click that does the necessary calculations, then output the results to the page.

Feel free to use the functions from the [JavaScript Calculator Exercise](https://github.com/fe-101-sea-nov-15-2016/javascript-calculator).
